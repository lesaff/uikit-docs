# Print

<p class="uk-text-lead">Optimize your pages for legible and economic printing.</p>

This component is based on the print styles from [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). It strips your document from background colors and changes font colors to black to save printer ink. Pictures will be scaled down to fit the page and anchors are underlined to distinguish them from regular text.

This component is applied by a media query (`@media print`) and does not need to be directly added to your classes.

## Modifications

For UIkit, we removed the link `href` and `title` related rules.
